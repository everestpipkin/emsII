I do not wish to be affiliated with this me me. I did not start this me me. Nor did I share this me me. I have no part in the creation of this me me. I do not encourage this me me. I do not wish for the spreading of this me me. I wish for the end of this me me. I despise this me me. I will hurt anyone one who speaks of this me me. The proof of the human race being doomed is the direct by product of this me me. I do not want to be accused of being part of this me me. I do not want to become this me me. I want the destruction of this me me. I refuse to be in the presence of anyone who speaks of this me me. Therefore, I believe this meme is evil.
