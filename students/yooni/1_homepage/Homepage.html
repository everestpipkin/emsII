        <h1>Welcome to... THE COLLECTION.</h1> 

         <h2>This is a (soon to be) extensive archive of every single Playstation 2 game that I played or saw gameplay for when I was a wee lad.<br>
         One day, when I have my own house and my own mancave and no one to tell me that I should get a job or a girlfriend, I hope to own <br>
         every single on of these games and have them on display. In doing this, I will be effectively creating a record of my life in the form <br>
         of various virtual escapades. I'm cool... I swear.</h2><br>

         <h3>Enjoy!</h3>  
         <br>

		
       

	
      <img src='/AeonFlux.jpg'/><br>
      	I dont remember this one too well, but I saw it on a Demo Disk once and I think my dad had seen the movie.<br>


      <img src="AlterEcho.jpg"><br>
      	You play as some goon in a purple and yellow suit and he an transform into this large boy with a big gun or a smol boy with a tiny gun.<br>


      <img src="Amplitude.jpg"><br>
      	Basically my introduction to how cool video game music could be. "Baseline" by Quarashi has my heart forever.<br>


      <img src="ApeEscape.jpg"><br>
      	You use a big butterfly net to catch monkeys with police sirens on their heads.<br>


      <img src="Area51.jpg"><br>
      	This game was absolutely terrifying. Or as terrifying as gunning down alien insurgents can be.<br>


      <img src="Battle.jpg"><br>
      	I piloted a awkwardly controlled mech for about thirty minutes and decided that there were better ways for me to spend my time.<br>


      <img src="Protector.jpg"><br>
      	As someone who snuck underneath their parents bed to watch the first episode of Ben 10 when it aired, I can say that I was deliciously satisfied.<br>


      <img src="bge.jpg"><br>
      	You take pictures of monsters and animals. Some of them you kill. Not the pig though. He's mad cool.<br>


      <img src="Burnout.jpg"><br>
      	This is the game is like if Fast and Furious was less about a plot and winning a race and more about lighting your tires on fire.<br>
